              <p><b>Anna Choi, Founder, Event Producer</b></p>
              <p>Anna Sun Choi, President of JoySprout Productions, is fiercely committed to producing creative, remarkable event experiences for cause-driven organizations that support social change. She brings  a unique global perspective living abroad in Italy and South Korea, and visiting Africa, Costa Rica and Qatar. Formally trained as an artist, she wasn’t clear how to make tons of money as an artist and went the opposite extreme forgoing all creativity by becoming a Financial Planner. Her three year plan to make six figures didn’t pan out in an industry that doesn’t reward creativity. 
              </p>
              <p>After selling her 5 year financial planning practice in 2010, she created JoySprout Productions who helps leaders of cause driven organizations that want to get their message out, make money and build their community. </p>
              <p>Anna is a TEDxBellevue Organizer and a Self Expression and Leadership Program Leader, bringing over 5000+ hours of professional training and development in communication, leadership, and team management that allow for you as an organization to be heard to manifest your vision, impact social change, sustainably make money, and unleash joy along the way!</p>
